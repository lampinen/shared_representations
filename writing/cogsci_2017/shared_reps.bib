abstract = {It is a striking fact that in humans the greatest learnmg occurs precisely at that point in time - childhood - when the most dramatic maturational changes also occur. This report describes possible synergistic interactions between maturational change and the ability to learn a complex domain (language), as investigated in connectionist networks. The networks are trained to process complex sentences involving relative clauses, number agreement, and several types of verb argument structure. Training fails in the case of networks which are fully formed and ‘adultlike' in their capacity. Training succeeds only when networks begin with limited working memory and gradually ‘mature' to the adult state. This result suggests that rather than being a limitation, developmental restrictions on resources may constitute a necessary prerequisite for mastering certain complex domains. Specifically, successful learning may depend on starting small.},

Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6{\%} to 93.2{\%} and from 88.0{\%} to 93.8{\%} on Omniglot compared to competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same model on language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.},

abstract = {Bayesian models of cognition hypothesize that human brains make sense of data by representing prob-ability distributions and applying Bayes' rule to find the best explanation for any given data. Under-standing the neural mechanisms underlying probabilistic models remains important because Bayesian models essentially provide a computational framework, rather than specifying processes at the algo-rithmic level. Here, we propose a constructive neural-network model which estimates and represents probability distributions from observable events — a phenomenon related to the concept of proba-bility matching. We use a form of operant learning, where the underlying probabilities are learned from positive and negative reinforcements of inputs. Our model is psychologically plausible because, similar to humans, it learns to represent probabilities without receiving any representation of them from the external world, but rather by experiencing individual events. Moreover, we show that our neural implementation of probability matching can be paired with a neural module applying Bayes' rule, forming a comprehensive neural scheme to simulate human Bayesian learning and inference. Our model also provides novel explanations of several deviations from Bayes, including base-rate neglect and overweighting of rare events.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine brain areas involved in simple arithmetic, and to compare these areas between adults and children. Eight children (four girls and four boys; age, 9-14 years) and eight adults (four women and four men; age, 40-49 years) were subjected to this study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during mental calculation of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of single digits. In each group, the left middle frontal, bilateral inferior temporal and bilateral lateral occipital cortices were activated during each task. The adult group showed activation of the right frontal cortex during addition and multiplication tasks, but the children group did not. Activation of the intraparietal cortex was observed in the adult group during each task. Although, activation patterns were slightly different among tasks, as well as between groups, only a small number of areas showed statistically significant differences. The results indicate that cortical networks involved in simple arithmetic are similar among arithmetic operations, and may not show significant changes in the structure during the second decade of life. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this dissertation we develop a new formal graphical framework for causal reasoning. Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions. ERRATA: (i) Pages 41-42: Objects of a causal theory are words, not collections, in {\$}V{\$}, and we include swaps as generating morphisms, subject to the identities defining a symmetric monoidal category.

The main innovation of the architecture is that it combines associative and competitive learning in order to learn task decompositions. A task decomposition is discovered by forcing the networks comprising the architecture to compete to learn the training patterns. As a result of the competition, different networks learn different training patterns and, thus, learn to partition the input space. The performance of the architecture on a "what" and "where" vision task and on a multi-payload robotics task are presented.},

First, we show that SGD can be used to learn the best possible sampling distribution of an importance sampling estimator. Second, we show that the sampling distribution of a SGD algorithm can be estimated online by incrementally minimizing the variance of the gradient. The resulting algorithm - called Adaptive Weighted SGD (AW-SGD) - maintains a set of parameters to optimize, as well as a set of parameters to sample learning examples. We show that AW-SGD yields faster convergence in three different applications: (i) image classification with deep features, where the sampling of images depends on their labels, (ii) matrix factorization, where rows and columns are not sampled uniformly, and (iii) reinforcement learning, where the optimized and explore policies are estimated at the same time.},

abstract = {Amazon's Mechanical Turk is an online labor market where requesters post jobs and workers choose which jobs to do for pay. The central purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to use this Web site for conducting behavioral research and to lower the barrier to entry for researchers who could benefit from this platform. We describe general techniques that apply to a variety of types of research and experiments across disciplines. We begin by discussing some of the advantages of doing experiments on Mechanical Turk, such as easy access to a large, stable, and diverse subject pool, the low cost of doing experiments, and faster iteration between developing theory and executing experiments. While other methods of conducting behavioral research may be comparable to or even better than Mechanical Turk on one or more of the axes outlined above, we will show that when taken as a whole Mechanical Turk can be a useful tool for many researchers. We will discuss how the behavior of workers compares with that of experts and laboratory subjects. Then we will illustrate the mechanics of putting a task on Mechanical Turk, including recruiting subjects, executing the task, and reviewing the work that was submitted. We also provide solutions to common problems that a researcher might face when executing their research on this platform, including techniques for conducting synchronous experiments, methods for ensuring high-quality work, how to keep data private, and how to maintain code security.},

The combined method identifies both the mental states and how their durations vary with experimental conditions. We apply this method to a task where participants solve novel mathematical problems. We identify four states in the solution of these problems: Encoding, Planning, Solving, and Respond. The method allows us to interpret what participants are doing on individual problem-solving trials. The duration of the planning state varies on a trial-to-trial basis with novelty of the problem. The duration of solution stage similarly varies with the amount of computation needed to produce a solution once a plan is devised. The response stage similarly varies with the complexity of the answer produced. In addition, we identified a number of effects that ran counter to a prior model of the task. Thus, we were able to decompose the overall problem-solving time into estimates of its components and in way that serves to guide theory.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the fate of the central ideas behind the complementary learning systems (CLS) framework as originally articulated in McClelland, McNaughton, and O'Reilly (1995). This framework explains why the brain requires two differentially specialized learning and memory systems, and it nicely specifies their central properties (i.e., the hippocampus as a sparse, pattern-separated system for rapidly learning episodic memories, and the neocortex as a distributed, overlapping system for gradually integrating across episodes to extract latent semantic structure). We review the application of the CLS framework to a range of important topics, including the following: the basic neural processes of hippocampal memory encoding and recall, conjunctive encoding, human recognition memory, consolidation of initial hippocampal learning in cortex, dynamic modulation of encoding versus recall, and the synergistic interactions between hippocampus and neocortex. Overall, the CLS framework remains a vital theoretical force in the field, with the empirical data over the past 15 years generally confirming its key principles.},

The IQs of the 140 children (75 girls and 65 boys) retained in the study group (three were excluded because of low IQs) ranged from 80 to 129 (mean 98.2, SD 9.9). 26 per cent of the children had symptoms of ADHD, and 17 per cent had dyslexia. Their socio-economic status was significantly lower than that of the rest of the cohort, and 42 per cent had first-degree relatives with learning disabilities. The prevalence of dyscalculia in the original cohort was 6.5 per cent, similar to that of dyslexia and ADHD. However, unlike these other learning disabilities, dyscalculia affected the two sexes in about the same proportions.},

The Tic-Tat-Toe and its isomorphs are used to illustrate the procedures of the framework as a methodology and test the predictions of the framework as a functional model. Experimental results show that the behavior in the Tic-Tat-Toe is determined by the directly available information in external and internal representations in terms of perceptual and cognitive biases, regardless of whether the biases are consistent with, inconsistent with, or irrelevant to the task. It is shown that external representations are not merely inputs and stimuli to the internal mind and that they have much more important functions than mere memory aids. A representational determinism is suggested-the form of a representation determines what information can be perceived, what processes can be activated, and what structures can be discovered from the specific representation.},

abstract = {Means–ends analysis is a mechanism that is assumed to operate when people solve transformation problems. Its use is affected by the extent to which the goal is clearly specified to the problem solver as a problem state and by the extent to which learning occurs during a problem-solving episode. Five maze-tracing experiments were conducted with 116 undergraduates in which the finish point of the maze could be presented either as a specific location or in more general terms. The latter prevented the use of conventional means–ends analysis. Results indicate that on the particular maze configuration used, the nonspecific goal resulted in fewer errors and more rapid learning of the structure of the problem. Under conditions that facilitated the use of means–ends analyses, knowledge of the goal location rendered the problem insoluble. General results were replicated with the use of numerical problems. Implications for the generality of means–ends analysis as a problem-solving mechanism are discussed. (11 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

We summarize here the major sources of evidence for chunking mechanisms, and consider how such mechanisms have been implemented in computational models of the learning process. We distinguish two forms of chunking: the first deliberate, under strategic control, and goal-oriented; the second automatic, continuous, and linked to perceptual processes. Recent work with discrimination-network computational models of long- and short-term memory (EPAM/CHREST) has produced a diverse range of applications of perceptual chunking. We focus on recent successes in verbal learning, expert memory, language acquisition and learning multiple representations, to illustrate the implementation and use of chunking mechanisms within contemporary models of human learning.},

Eight children (four girls and four boys; age, 9-14 years) and eight adults (four women and four men; age, 40-49 years) were subjected to this study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during mental calculation of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of single digits. In each group, the left middle frontal, bilateral inferior temporal and bilateral lateral occipital cortices were activated during each task. The adult group showed activation of the right frontal cortex during addition and multiplication tasks, but the children group did not. Activation of the intraparietal cortex was observed in the adult group during each task. Although, activation patterns were slightly different among tasks, as well as between groups, only a small number of areas showed statistically significant differences. The results indicate that cortical networks involved in simple arithmetic are similar among arithmetic operations, and may not show significant changes in the structure during the second decade of life. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

How can we have the idea of a general triangle even though every experience with triangles is with specific ones? Classical cognitive science seemed to provide an answer in symbolic representation. With its easily enumerated necessary and sufficient conditions, the triangle would appear to be a ideal candidate for being represented in a symbolic form. I show that it is not. Across a variety of tasks—drawing, speeded recognition, unspeeded visual judgments, and inference—representations of triangles appear to be graded and contextdependent. I show that using the category name “triangle” activates a more prototypical representation than using an arguably coextensive cue, “three-sided polygon.” For example, when asked to draw “triangles” people draw more typical triangles than when asked to draw “three-sided polygons.” Altogether, the results support the view that (even formal) concepts have a graded and flexible structure which takes on a more prototypical and stable form when activated by category labels.},

With positron emission tomography (PET), we investigated the neural bases of the cognitive abilities of an expert calculator and a group of non-experts, contrasting complex mental calculation to memory retrieval of arithmetic facts. We demonstrated that calculation expertise was not due to increased activity of processes that exist in non-experts; rather, the expert and the non-experts used different brain areas for calculation. We found that the expert could switch between short-term effort-requiring storage strategies and highly efficient episodic memory encoding and retrieval, a process that was sustained by right prefrontal and medial temporal areas.},

abstract = {Knowledge tracing—where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework—is a well established problem in computer supported education. Though effectively modeling student knowledge would have high ed-ucational impact, the task has many inherent challenges. In this paper we explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. Using neu-ral networks results in substantial improvements in prediction performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward interpretation and dis-covery of structure in student tasks. These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary application task for RNNs.},

abstract = {We propose a simple, elegant solution to use a single Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate between multiple languages. Our solution requires no change in the model architecture from our base system but instead introduces an artificial token at the beginning of the input sentence to specify the required target language. The rest of the model, which includes encoder, decoder and attention, remains unchanged and is shared across all languages. Using a shared wordpiece vocabulary, our approach enables Multilingual NMT using a single model without any increase in parameters, which is significantly simpler than previous proposals for Multilingual NMT. Our method often improves the translation quality of all involved language pairs, even while keeping the total number of model parameters constant. On the WMT'14 benchmarks, a single multilingual model achieves comparable performance for English→French and surpasses state-of-the-art results for English→German. Similarly, a single multilingual model surpasses state-of-the-art results for French→English and German→English on WMT'14 and WMT'15 benchmarks respectively. On production corpora, multilingual models of up to twelve language pairs allow for better translation of many individual pairs. In addition to improving the translation quality of language pairs that the model was trained with, our models can also learn to perform implicit bridging between language pairs never seen explicitly during training, showing that transfer learning and zero-shot translation is possible for neural translation. Finally, we show analyses that hints at a universal interlingua representation in our models and show some interesting examples when mixing languages.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the causes for large differences in difficulty of various isomorphic versions of the Tower of Hanoi problem. Some forms of the problem take 16 times as long to solve, on average, as other versions. Since isomorphism rules out size of task domain as a determinant of relative difficulty, these experiments seek and find causes for the differences in features of the problem representation. Analysis of verbal protocols and the temporal patterning of moves allows the problem-solving behavior to be divided into exploratory and final-path phases. Entry into the final-path phase depends on acquisition of the ability to plan pairs of moves, an achievement made difficult by the working memory load it entails. This memory load can be reduced by automating the rules governing moves, either through problem exploration or training. Once automation has occurred, the solution is obtained very rapidly. Memory load is also proposed as the locus of other differences in difficulty found between various problem representations. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {We explore the effect of introducing prior information into the intermediate level of neural networks for a learning task on which all the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms tested failed to learn. We motivate our work from the hy- pothesis that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experi- ments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first level of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second level takes the output of the first level as input and predicts the final task target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thou- sand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, de- cision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not per- formed is due to the composition of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably because of effective lo- cal minima.},

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

Solving integrals activated a left-lateralized cortical network including the horizontal intraparietal sulcus, posterior superior parietal lobe, posterior cingulate gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our results indicate that solving of more abstract and sophisticated mathematical facts, such as calculus integrals, elicits a pattern of brain activation similar to the cortical network engaged in basic numeric comparison, quantity manipulation, and arithmetic problem solving. },

@article{McClelland2013,
abstract = {The complementary learning systems theory of the roles of hippocampus and neocortex (McClelland, McNaughton, {\&} O'Reilly, 1995) holds that the rapid integration of arbitrary new information into neocortical structures is avoided to prevent catastrophic interference with structured knowledge representations stored in synaptic connections among neocortical neurons. Recent studies (Tse et al., 2007, 2011) showed that neocortical circuits can rapidly acquire new associations that are consistent with prior knowledge. The findings challenge the complementary learning systems theory as previously presented. However, new simulations extending those reported in McClelland et al. (1995) show that new information that is consistent with knowledge previously acquired by a putatively cortexlike artificial neural network can be learned rapidly and without interfering with existing knowledge; it is when inconsistent new knowledge is acquired quickly that catastrophic interference ensues. Several important features of the findings of Tse et al. (2007, 2011) are captured in these simulations, indicating that the neural network model used in McClelland et al. has characteristics in common with neocortical learning mechanisms. An additional simulation generalizes beyond the network model previously used, showing how the rate of change of cortical connections can depend on prior knowledge in an arguably more biologically plausible network architecture. In sum, the findings of Tse et al. are fully consistent with the idea that hippocampus and neocortex are complementary learning systems. Taken together, these findings and the simulations reported here advance our knowledge by bringing out the role of consistency of new experience with existing knowledge and demonstrating that the rate of change of connections in real and artificial neural networks can be strongly prior-knowledge dependent.},

We tested the logical understanding of number words in 84 children that were classified as "cardinal-principle knowers" by the criteria set forth by Wynn (1992). Results show that these children often do not know (1) which of two numbers in their count list denotes a greater quantity, and (2) that the difference between successive numbers in their count list is 1. Among counters, these abilities are predicted by the highest number to which they can count and their ability to estimate set sizes. Also, children's knowledge of the principles appears to be initially item-specific rather than general to all number words, and is most robust for very small numbers (e.g., 5) compared to larger numbers (e.g., 25), even among children who can count much higher (e.g., above 30). In light of these findings, we conclude that there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that becoming a cardinal-principle knower involves a semantic induction over all items in a child's count list. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This article reviews psychological and educational research to propose that refining K–12 classroom instruction such that students draw connections through relational comparisons may enhance their long-term ability to transfer and engage with mathematics as a meaningful system. We begin by examining the mathematical knowledge of students in one community college, reviewing results that show even after completing a K–12 required mathematics sequence, these students were unlikely to flexibly reason about mathematics. Rather than drawing relationships between presented problems or inferences about the representations, students preferred to attempt previously memorized (often incorrect) procedures (Givvin, Stigler, {\&} Thompson, 2011; Stigler, Givvin, {\&} Thompson, 2010). We next describe the relations between the cognition of flexible, comparative reasoning and experimentally derived strategies for supporting students' ability to make these connections. A cross-cultural study found that U.S. teachers currently use these strategies much less frequently than their international counterparts (Hiebert et al., 2003; Richland, Zur, {\&} Holyoak, 2007), suggesting that these practices may be correlated with high student performance. Finally, we articulate a research agenda for improving and studying pedagogical practices for fostering students' relational thinking about mathematics.},

abstract = {The reparameterization trick enables the optimization of large scale stochastic computation graphs via gradient descent. The essence of the trick is to refactor each stochastic node into a differentiable function of its parameters and a random variable with fixed distribution. After refactoring, the gradients of the loss propagated by the chain rule through the graph are low variance unbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss. While many continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random variables lack continuous reparameterizations due to the discontinuous nature of discrete states. In this work we introduce concrete random variables -- continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The concrete distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated continuously, concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives (including objectives that depend on the log-likelihood of latent stochastic nodes) on the corresponding discrete graph. We demonstrate their effectiveness on density estimation and structured prediction tasks using neural networks.},

abstract = {Invariant visual object recognition and the underlying neural representations are fundamental to higher-level human cognition. To understand these neural underpinnings, we combine human and monkey psychophysics, large-scale neurophysiology, neural perturbation methods, and computational modeling to construct falsifiable, predictive models that aim to fully account for the neural encoding and decoding processes that underlie visual object recognition. A predictive encoding model must minimally describe the transformation of the retinal image to population patterns of neural activity along the entire cortical ventral stream of visual processing and must accurately predict the responses to any retinal image. A predictive decoding model must minimally describe the transformation from those population patterns of neural activity to observed object recognition behavior (i.e., subject reports), and, given that population pattern of activity, it must accurately predict behavior for any object recognition task. To date, we have focused on core object recognition-a remarkable behavior that is accomplished with image viewing durations of {\textless}200 msec. Our work thus far reveals that the neural encoding process is reasonably well explained by a largely feed-forward, highly complex, multistaged nonlinear neural network-the current best neuronal simulation models predict approximately one-half of the relevant neuronal response variance across the highest levels of the ventral stream (areas V4 and IT). Remarkably, however, the decoding process from IT to behavior for all object recognition tasks tested thus far is very accurately predicted by simple direct linear conversion of the inferior temporal neural population state to behavior choice. We have recently examined the behavioral consequences of direct suppression of IT neural activity using pharmacological and optogenetic methods and find them to be well-explained by the same linear decoding model.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT — This article examines the role of working memo- ry, attention shifting, and inhibitory control executive cogni- tive functions in the development of mathematics knowledge and ability in children. It suggests that an examination of the executive cognitive demand of mathematical thinking can complement procedural and conceptual knowledge-based approaches to understanding the ways in which children become profi cient in mathematics. Task analysis indicates that executive cognitive functions likely operate in concert with procedural and conceptual knowledge and in some instances might act as a unique infl uence on mathematics problem-solving ability. It is concluded that consideration of the executive cognitive demand of mathematics can contribute to research on best practices in mathematics education.},

abstract = {Behavior and experience are organized around the enjoyment and pursuit of incentives. During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

abstract = {Background: Cataracts are a major cause of childhood blindness globally. Although surgically treatable, it is unclear whether children would benefit from such interventions beyond the first few years of life, which are believed to constitute 'critical' periods for visual development. Aims To study visual acuity outcomes after late treatment of early-onset cataracts and also to determine whether there are longitudinal changes in postoperative acuity. Methods: We identified 53 children with dense cataracts with an onset within the first half-year after birth through a survey of over 20 000 rural children in India. All had accompanying nystagmus and were older than 8 years of age at the time of treatment. They underwent bilateral cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation. We then assessed their best-corrected visual acuity 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Results: 48 children from the pool of 53 showed improvement in their visual acuity after surgery. Our longitudinal assessments demonstrated further improvements in visual acuity for the majority of these children proceeding from the 6-week to 6-month assessment. Interestingly, older children in our subject pool did not differ significantly from the younger ones in the extent of improvement they exhibit. Conclusions: and relevance Our results demonstrate that not only can significant vision be acquired until late in childhood, but that neural processes underlying even basic aspects of vision like resolution acuity remain malleable until at least adolescence. These data argue for the provision of cataract treatment to all children, irrespective of their age.},

abstract = {Worked examples are instructional devices that provide an expert's problem solution for a learner to study. Worked-examples research is a cognitive-experimental program that has relevance to classroom in- struction and the broader educational research community. A frame- work for organizing the findings of this research is proposed, leading to instructional design principles. For instance, one instructional de- sign principle suggests that effective examples have highly integrated components. They employ multiple modalities in presentation and em- phasize conceptual structure by labeling or segmenting. At the lesson level, effective instruction employs multiple examples for each concep- tual problem type, varies example formats within problem type, and employs surface features to signal deep structure. Also, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems. More- over, learners can be encouraged through direct training or by the structure of the worked example to actively self-explain examples. Worked examples are associated with early stages of skill develop- ment, but the design principles are relevant to constructivist research and teaching. The},

abstract = {A systematic review may encompass both odds ratios and mean differences in continuous outcomes. A separate meta-analysis of each type of outcome results in loss of information and may be misleading. It is shown that a ln(odds ratio) can be converted to effect size by dividing by 1.81. The validity of effect size, the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation, depends on comparable variation across studies. If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation, any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and effect sizes in a single meta-analysis when this is justified.},

abstract = {Although a general sense of the magnitude, quantity, or numerosity of objects is common in both untrained people and animals, the abilities to deal exactly with large quantities and to reason precisely in complex but well-specified situations--to behave formally, that is--are skills unique to people trained in symbolic notations. These symbolic notations typically employ complex, hierarchically embedded structures, which all extant analyses assume are constructed by concatenative, rule-based processes. The primary goal of this article is to establish, using behavioral measures on naturalistic tasks, that some of the same cognitive resources involved in representing spatial relations and proximities are also involved in representing symbolic notations--in short, that formal notations are a kind of diagram. We examined self-generated productions in the domains of handwritten arithmetic expressions and typewritten statements in a formal logic. In both tasks, we found substantial evidence for spatial representational schemes even in these highly symbolic domains.},

How is the knowledge underlying these abilities acquired, and how is it affected by brain disorders? Our approach to these issues is based on the idea that cognitive processes arise from the interactions of neurons through synaptic connections. The knowledge in such interactive and distributed processing systems is stored in the strengths of the connections and is acquired gradually through experience. Degradation of semantic knowledge occurs through degradation of the patterns of neural activity that probe the knowledge stored in the connections. Simulation models based on these ideas capture semantic cognitive processes and their development and disintegration, encompassing domain-specific patterns of generalization in young children, and the restructuring of conceptual knowledge as a function of experience.},

Two-operation problems yielded major activations in bilateral frontal regions similar to those found in other problem-solving tasks, indicating that the processes mediated by these regions subserve many forms of reasoning.

The result is a new global log- bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word co- occurrence matrix, rather than on the en- tire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. On a recent word analogy task our model obtains 75{\%} accuracy, an improvement of 11{\%} over Mikolov et al. (2013).

@article{Pashler2008,
abstract = {The term “learning styles” refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most common—but not the only—hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a “visual learner,” emphasizing visual presentation of information).The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

abstract = {We present a new model of skilled performance in geometry proof problem solving called the Diagram Configuration model (DC). While previous models plan proofs in a step-by-step fashion, we observed that experts plan at a more abstract level: They focus on the key steps and skip the less important ones. DC models this abstract planning behavior by parsing geometry problem diagrams into perceptual chunks, called diagram configurations, which cue relevant schematic knowledge. We provide verbal protocol evidence that DC's schemas correspond with the step-skipping inferences experts make in their initial planning. We compare DC with other models of geometry expertise and then, in the final section, we discuss more general implications of our research. DC's reasoning has important similarities with Larkin's (1988) display-based reasoning approach and Johnson-Laird's (1983) mental model approach. DC's perceptually based schemas are a step towards a unified explanation of (1) experts' superior problem-solving effectiveness, (2) experts' superior problem-state memory, and (3) experts' ability, in certain domains, to solve relatively simple problems by pure forward inferencing. We also argue that the particular and efficient knowledge organization of DC challenges current theories of skill acquisition as it presents an end-state of learning that is difficult to explain within such theories. Finally, we discuss the implications of DC for geometry instruction. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Previous studies have found that the strategies used by expert and novice problem solvers differ. Novices tend to use means-ends analysis, which involves working backward from the goal, whereas experts prefer to work forward from the givens of a problem. Experiment 1 was designed to study the course of development of expertise using a subset of kinematics problems. After solving many problems, subjects demonstrated the switch from a means-ends to a forward-chaining strategy. This was associated with the conventional concomitants of expertise such as a decrease in the number of moves required for solution. In addition, the speed at which expertise developed varied for different categories of problems. Subjects appeared to categorize problems according to the order in which equations would be required, with these categories being discovered at nonuniform rates. This was assumed to be due to the differential rate of acquisition of schemas associated with different categories of problems. Experiments 2 and 3, again using kinematics problems, tested the hypothesis that the means-ends strategies used by novices retarded the acquisition of appropriate'schemas. It was suggested that under a means-ends strategy, moves are controlled by the problem goal, which reduces the information obtained by problem solvers concerning problem structure. The use of nonspecific rather than specific goals was found to enhance the acquisition of expertise as measured by the use of a forward-oriented strategy, the number of moves required for solution, and the number of equations written without substitutions. Experiments 4 and 5, using geometry problems, duplicated the enhanced rate of strategy alteration found with reduced goal specificity. The results of Experiments 6 and 7, again using geometry problems, indicated that reduced goal specificity also enhanced the rate at which problem solvers induced appropriate problem categories. It was concluded that in circumstances in which the primary reason for presenting problems is to assist problem solvers in acquiring knowledge concerning problem structure, the use of conventional problems solved by means-ends analysis may not be maximally efficient.},

We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

By contrast, the computer vision community uses complicated, hand-engineered representations of the pose of the feature, like SIFT, that produce a whole vector of outputs including an explicit representation of the pose of the feature. We show how neural networks can be used to learn features that output a whole vector of instatiation parameters and we argue that this is a much more promising way of dealing with variations in position, orientation, scale and lighting than the methods currently employed in the neural networks community. It is also more promising than the hand-engineered features currently used in computer vision because it provides an efficient way of adpating the features to the domain},

abstract = {We propose a theory that relates difficulty of learning in deep architectures to culture and language. It is articulated around the following hypotheses: (1) learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effective local minima; (2) this optimization difficulty is particularly important when it comes to learning higher-level abstractions, i.e., concepts that cover a vast and highly-nonlinear span of sensory configurations; (3) such high-level abstrac- tions are best represented in brains by the composition of many levels of representation, i.e., by deep architectures; (4) a human brain can learn such high-level abstractions if guided by the signals produced by other humans, which act as hints or indirect supervision for these high-level abstractions; and (5), language and the recombination and optimization of mental concepts provide an efficient evolutionary recombination operator, and this gives rise to rapid search in the space of communicable ideas that help humans build up better high-level internal representations of their world. These hypotheses put together imply that human culture and the evolution of ideas have been crucial to counter an optimization difficulty: this optimization difficulty would otherwise make it very difficult for human brains to capture high-level knowl- edge of the world. The theory is grounded in experimental observations of the difficulties of training deep artificial neural networks. Plausible consequences of this theory for the efficiency of cultural evolution are sketched.},

abstract = {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.},

abstract = {Cognitive science aims to reverse-engineer the mind, and many of the engineering challenges the mind faces involve inductive inference. The probabilistic approach to modeling cognition begins with the goal of understanding these inductive problems in computational terms: what makes them difficult, and how they can be solved in principle. Mental processes are then modeled using algorithms for approximately implementing these ideal solutions, and neural processes are viewed as mechanisms for implementing these algorithms in biological hardware. This top-down approach is analogous to historical progressions of theory building in other natural sciences, moving from macro-level functional explanations of observable phenomena to micro-level mechanistic accounts. Typical connectionist models, by contrast, follow a bottom-up approach, starting from an abstract characterization of neural mechanisms and exploring what macro-level functional phenomena might emerge from those mechanisms. We suggest that the top-down approach is likely to yield more rapid progress towards understanding human inductive inference.},

abstract = {Continuous space language models have re- cently demonstrated outstanding results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we ex- amine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40{\%} of the questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regu- larities by using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions. Re- markably, this method outperforms the best previous systems. 1},

abstract = {We studied the ability of barn owls to recover accurate sound localization after being raised with one ear occluded. Most of the owls had ear plugs inserted before they reached adult size, and therefore they never experienced normal adult localization cues until their ear plugs were removed. Upon removal of their ear plugs, these owls exhibited large systematic sound localization errors. The rate at which they recovered accurate localization decreased with the age of the bird at the time of plug removal, and recovery essentially ceased when owls reached 38 to 42 weeks of age. We interpret this age as the end of a critical period for the consolidation of associations between auditory cues and locations in space. Owls that had experienced adult localization cues for a short period of time before ear plugging recovered normal accuracy rapidly, even if they remained plugged well past the end of the critical period. This suggests that a brief exposure to normal adult cues early in the critical period is sufficient to enable the recovery of localization accuracy much later in life.},

In Exp 1, using 48 Ss, transfer was investigated in a case where the mapping between the domains was transparent so any transfer decrement must arise because the knowledge was perceptually-bound. The domains were colors and names of colors. In Exp 2, using 40 Ss, the relationship between consciousness and transfer was tested. In the test phase for each experiment, Ss were informed that there was a complex set of rules that governed the order of the items in each string, and were told to classify the strings. Exp 2 used letters and Ss were asked for a confidence judgement on a scale from 50–100. Exp 1 demonstrated that knowledge of artificial grammars was actually relatively inflexible in its application, in that there was limited transfer between 2 domains with obvious mappings. Results for Exp 2 indicate that the knowledge had an unconscious component in both the same and different domains. It is concluded that grammar learning is a useful paradigm for exploring the links between consciousness and flexibility. The training and test items are appended.},

In a selection task, the learner actively chooses observations to test his or her beliefs, whereas in reception tasks data are passively encountered. People routinely use both forms of testing in everyday life, but the critical psychological differences between selection and reception learning remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that selection learning improves learning performance by enhancing generic cognitive processes related to motivation, attention, and engagement. Alternatively, we suggest that differences between these 2 learning modes derives from a hypothesis-dependent sampling bias that is introduced when a person collects data to test his or her own individual hypothesis. Drawing on influential models of sequential hypothesis-testing behavior, we show that such a bias (a) can lead to the collection of data that facilitates learning compared with reception learning and (b) can be more effective than observing the selections of another person. We then report a novel experiment based on a popular category learning paradigm that compares reception and selection learning. We additionally compare selection learners to a set of “yoked” participants who viewed the exact same sequence of observations under reception conditions. The results revealed systematic differences in performance that depended on the learner's role in collecting information and the abstract structure of the problem.},

Although decades of research have focused on the advantages and disadvantages of concrete and abstract materials considered independently, we argue for an approach that moves beyond this dichotomy and combines their advantages. Specifically, we recommend beginning with concretematerials and then explicitly and gradually fading to the more abstract. Theoretical benefits of this “con- creteness fading” technique for mathematics and science instruction include (1) helping learners interpret ambiguous or opaque abstract symbols in terms of well-understood concrete objects, (2) providing embodied perceptual and physical experiences that can ground abstract thinking, (3) enabling learners to build up a store of memorable images that can be used when abstract symbols lose meaning, and (4) guiding learners to strip away extraneous concrete properties and distill the generic, generalizable properties. In these ways, concreteness fading provides advantages that go beyond the sum of the benefits of concrete and abstract materials},

They thus fail to construct a proof because they could not use the syntactic knowledge that they had. By comparing doctoral students and undergraduates constructing proofs in abstract algebra, I have hypothesized four types of `strategic knowledge' – knowledge of how to choose which facts and theorems to apply – which the doctoral students appeared to possess and undergraduates did not. The doctoral students appeared to know the powerful proof techniques in abstract algebra, which theorems are most important, when particular facts and theorems are likely to be useful, and when one should or should not try and prove theorems using symbol manipulation.},

Two single-stage accounts (i.e., cumulative frequency and a neural-network simulation) are considered in regard to their predictions concerning the interactions between AoA and frequency with aging and priming effects. A repetition-priming face-classification task was conducted on both older and younger participants to test these predictions. Consistent with the predictions of the neural-network simulation, AoA had an effect on reaction times that could not be explained by cumulative frequency alone. Also, as predicted by the simulation, the size of the priming effect was determined by the cumulative frequency of the item. It is discussed how this evidence is supportive of the notion that AoA , frequency, and priming all have effects at a common and single stage during face processing.},

Our solution is inspired by the recently proposed neural machine translation model which generalizes machine translation as a sequence learning problem. We extend the neural machine translation to a multi-task learning framework which shares source language representation and separates the modeling of different target language translation. Our framework can be applied to situations where either large amounts of parallel data or limited parallel data is available. Experiments show that our multi-task learning model is able to achieve significantly higher translation quality over individually learned model in both situations on the data sets publicly available.},

abstract = {A method has been developed for measuring the rate of phagocytosis rather than the quantity of particles ingested per cell when the process is virtually complete. The method, which is simpler and more rapid than those described previously, utilizes cellular monolayers, radioactive particles, and short incubation times. Under the conditions described, the rate of uptake of particles by either guinea-pig peritoneal or human blood leukocytes was proportional to both cell concentration and the time of incubation, and was independent of changes in the concentration of particles during the measurement. The particles were retained by the cells for at least 90 min. The most suitable particles so far used have been (32)P-labeled Salmonella typhimurium, and acetyl-(14)C- or methyl-(14)C-labeled starch particles. The oxidation of (14)C-labeled glucose has been studied under the same conditions that were used for the assays of phagocytosis: the greatest increase in formation of (14)CO(2) from glucose-1-(14)C occurred a few minutes after the most rapid period of phagocytosis.},

The experiment to be reported was designed primarily to answer two questions: How does the difficulty of learning vary from one type of classification to another? Is something specific learned abut the structure of a classification that will transfer positively to the subsequent learning of a new classification of that same type? The experimental procedure conformed to the usual paired-associate paradigm except that only two responses were used. That is, the eight stimuli were presented, one at a time, in a continuing random sequence and an association between each stimulus and one of two alternative classificatory responses was built up by the method of anticipation. Six female freshmen at Fairleigh Dickinson University served for 15 hours each in this first experiment. These subjects ( S s) were selected to be as uniform as possible with respect to their college entrance examination scores. A combined empirical and theoretical investigation of the difficulties of different kinds of classifications was undertaken using both learning and memory tasks. Sets of stimuli of a variety of kinds were used but, in each set, there were eight stimuli each of which took on one of two possible values on each of three different dimensions. Results showed that of the 70 possible classifications of the eight stimuli into two equal groups, there are only six basic types. The different classifications belonging to any one of these types have the same structure; they differ only with respect to which of the three dimensions is assigned to which of the three roles in the classification, and with respect to which of the two classificatory responses is assigned to which group of four stimuli.},

Integrating elements of social disorganization theory and family stress models, and results from structural equation models suggest that both neighborhood and family mechanisms played an important role in the transmission of neighborhood socioeconomic effects. Neighborhood disadvantage manifested its effect via lower neighborhood cohesion, which was associated with maternal depression and family dysfunction.

abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving perfor- mance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recog- nition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

Sixty-six 11th grade students participated in a mathematical verification paradigm, while pupil dilation as a measure of resource allocation was collected. Students with high fluid intelligence solved the tasks faster and more accurately than those with average fluid intelligence, as did students with high compared to average numerical intelligence. However, fluid intelligence sped up response times only in students with average but not high numerical intelligence. Further, high fluid but not numerical intelligence led to greater task-related pupil dilation. We assume that fluid intelligence serves as a domain-general resource that helps to tackle problems for which domain-specific knowledge (numerical intelligence) is missing. The allocation of this resource can be measured by pupil dilation.},

abstract = {Unsupervised learning of representations has been found useful in many applications and benefits from several advantages, e.g., where there are many un- labeled examples and few labeled ones (semi-supervised learning), or where the unlabeled or labeled examples are from a distribution different but related to the one of interest (self-taught learning, multi-task learning, and domain adaptation). Some of these algorithms have successfully been used to learn a hierarchy of features, i.e., to build a deep architecture, either as initialization for a supervised predictor, or as a generative model. Deep learning algorithms can yield representations that are more abstract and better disentangle the hidden factors of variation underlying the unknown generating distribution, i.e., to capture invariances and discover non-local structure in that distribution. This chapter reviews the main motivations and ideas behind deep learning algorithms and their representation-learning components, as well as recent results in this area, and proposes a vision of challenges and hopes on the road ahead, focusing on the questions of invariance and disentangling.},

abstract = {Enormous progress has been made in our understanding of adaptive plasticity in the central auditory system. Experiments on a range of species demonstrate that, in adults, the animal must attend to (i.e., respond to) a stimulus in order for plasticity to be induced, and the plasticity that is induced is specific for the acoustic feature to which the animal has attended. The requirement that an adult animal must attend to a stimulus in order for adaptive plasticity to occur suggests an essential role of neuromodulatory systems in gating plasticity in adults. Indeed, neuromodulators, particularly acetylcholine (ACh), that are associated with the processes of attention, have been shown to enable adaptive plasticity in adults. In juvenile animals, attention may facilitate plasticity, but it is not always required: during sensitive periods, mere exposure of an animal to an atypical auditory environment can result in large functional changes in certain auditory circuits. Thus, in both the developing and mature auditory systems substantial experience-dependent plasticity can occur, but the conditions under which it occurs are far more stringent in adults. We review experimental results that demonstrate experience-dependent plasticity in the central auditory representations of sound frequency, level and temporal sequence, as well as in the representations of binaural localization cues in both developing and adult animals. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units ("wordpieces") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of "character"-delimited models and the efficiency of "word"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60{\%} compared to Google's phrase-based production system.},

Towards this goal, we define a novel method of multitask and transfer learning that enables an autonomous agent to learn how to behave in multiple tasks simultaneously, and then generalize its knowledge to new domains. This method, termed "Actor-Mimic", exploits the use of deep reinforcement learning and model compression techniques to train a single policy network that learns how to act in a set of distinct tasks by using the guidance of several expert teachers. We then show that the representations learnt by the deep policy network are capable of generalizing to new tasks, speeding up learning in novel environments. Although our method can in general be applied to a wide range of problems, we use Atari games as a testing environment to demonstrate these methods.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

Symbols and processes that operate on them are often seen today as approximate characterizations of the emergent consequences of sub- or nonsymbolic processes, and a wide range of constructs in cognitive science can be understood as emergents. These include representational constructs (units, structures, rules), architectural constructs (central execu- tive, declarative memory), and developmental processes and outcomes (stages, sensitive periods, neurocognitive modules, developmental disorders). The greatest achievements of human cognition may be largely emergent phenomena.

abstract = {Most studies on mathematics learning in the field of educational neuroscience have focused on the neural correlates of very elementary numerical processing skills in children. Little is known about more complex mathematical skills that are formally taught in school, such as arithmetic. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study investigated how brain activation during single-digit addition and subtraction is modulated by problem size and arithmetic operation in 28 children aged 10-12. years with different levels of arithmetical fluency. Commensurate with adult data, large problems and subtractions activated a fronto-parietal network, including the intraparietal sulci, the latter of which indicates the influence of quantity-based processes during procedural strategy execution. Different from adults, the present findings revealed that particularly the left hippocampus was active during the solution of those problems that are expected to be solved by means of fact retrieval (i.e. small problems and addition), suggesting a specific role of the hippocampus in the early stages of learning arithmetic facts. Children with low levels of arithmetical fluency showed higher activation in the right intraparietal sulcus during the solution of problems with a relatively small problem size, indicating that they continued to rely to a greater extent on quantity-based strategies on those problems that the children with relatively higher arithmetical fluency already retrieved from memory. This might represent a neural correlate of fact retrieval impairments in children with mathematical difficulties. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Previous studies have found that the strategies used by expert and novice problem solvers differ. Novices tend to use means-ends analysis, which involves working backward from the goal, whereas experts prefer to work forward from the givens of a problem. Experiment 1 was designed to study the course of development of expertise using a subset of kinematics problems. After solving many problems, subjects demonstrated the switch from a means-ends to a forward-chaining strategy. This was associated with the conventional concomitants of expertise such as a decrease in the number of moves required for solution. In addition, the speed at which expertise developed varied for different categories of problems. Subjects appeared to categorize problems according to the order in which equations would be required, with these categories being discovered at nonuniform rates. This was assumed to be due to the differential rate of acquisition of schemas associated with different categories of problems. Experiments 2 and 3, again using kinematics problems, tested the hypothesis that the means-ends strategies used by novices retarded the acquisition of appropriate'schemas. It was suggested that under a means-ends strategy, moves are controlled by the problem goal, which reduces the information obtained by problem solvers concerning problem structure. The use of nonspecific rather than specific goals was found to enhance the acquisition of expertise as measured by the use of a forward-oriented strategy, the number of moves required for solution, and the number of equations written without substitutions. Experiments 4 and 5, using geometry problems, duplicated the enhanced rate of strategy alteration found with reduced goal specificity. The results of Experiments 6 and 7, again using geometry problems, indicated that reduced goal specificity also enhanced the rate at which problem solvers induced appropriate problem categories. It was concluded that in circumstances in which the primary reason for presenting problems is to assist problem solvers in acquiring knowledge concerning problem structure, the use of conventional problems solved by means-ends analysis may not be maximally efficient.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learn- ing residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, in- stead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide com- prehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex- ity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our ex- tremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative im- provement on the COCO object detection dataset.

It is inspired by Wittgenstein's language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer's capabilities. We created a game in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans' strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we compare computer strategies, showing how to quickly learn a semantic parsing model from scratch, and that modeling pragmatics further accelerates learning for successful players.},

In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the associationbetween nickel sensitization and exposure to orthodontic appliances and piercings. 4376adolescents were patch tested following a questionnaire asking for earlier piercing andorthodontic treatment. Exposure to orthodontic appliances was verified in dental records.Results. Questionnaire data demonstrated a reduced risk of nickel sensitization whenorthodontic treatment preceded piercing (OR 0.46; CI 0.27–0.78). Data from dentalrecords demonstrated similar results (OR 0.61, CI 0.36–1.02), but statistical significancewas lost when adjusting for background factors. Exposure to full, fixed applianceswith NiTi-containing alloys (OR 0.31, CI 0.10–0.98) as well as a pooled ‘high nickel-releasing' appliance group (OR 0.56, CI 0.32–0.97) prior to piercing was associated witha significantly reduced risk of nickel sensitization.Conclusion. High nickel-containing orthodontic appliances preceding piercingreduces the risk of nickel sensitization by a factor 1.5–2. The risk reduction is associatedwith estimated nickel release of the appliance and length of treatment. Sex, age at piercingand number of piercings are also important risk indicators.

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ldquoImageNetrdquo, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

abstract = {Probably the most important problem in machine learning is the preliminary biasing of a learner's hypothesis space so that it is small enough to ensure good generalisation from reasonable training sets, yet large enough that it contains a good solution to the problem being learnt. In this paper a mechanism for automatically learning or biasing the learner's hypothesis space is introduced. It works by rst learning an appropriate internal representation for a learning environment and then using that representation to bias the learner's hypothesis space for the learning of future tasks drawn from the same environment. An internal representation must be learnt by sampling from many similar tasks, not just a single task as occurs in ordinary machine learning. It is proved that the number of examples m per task required to ensure good generalisation from a representation learner obeys m = O(a+b=n) where n is the number of tasks being learnt and a and b are constants. If the tasks are learnt independently (i.e. without a common representation) then m = O(a+b). It is argued that for learning environments such as eech and character recognition b a and hence representation learning in these environments can potentially yield a drastic reduction in the number of examples required per task. It is also proved that if n = O(b) (with m = O(a+b=n)) then the representation learnt Appeared in Proceedings of the 8th International ACM Workshop on Computational Learning Theory (long talk). will be good for learning novel tasks from the same environment, and that the number of examples required to generalise well on a novel task will be reduced to O(a) (as opposed to O(a + b) if no representation is used). It is shown that gradient descent can be used to train neural network representations and the results of an experiment are reported in which a neural network representation was learnt for an environment consisting of translationally invariant Boolean functions. The experiment provides strong qualitative support for the theoretical results.},

abstract = {Despite the widespread practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos.},

It suggests that an examination of the executive cognitive demand of mathematical thinking can complement procedural and conceptual knowledge-based approaches to understanding the ways in which children become profi cient in mathematics. Task analysis indicates that executive cognitive functions likely operate in concert with procedural and conceptual knowledge and in some instances might act as a unique infl uence on mathematics problem-solving ability. It is concluded that consideration of the executive cognitive demand of mathematics can contribute to research on best practices in mathematics education.},

abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires decisions about the specifica- tion of the appropriate random-effects structure. Recently, Barr et al. (2013) recommended fitting ‘maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too com- plex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification. Finally, we clarify that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are atyp- ical for real data. A detailed example is provided of how subject-related attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

abstract = {This paper proposes new methods for generating input locations actively in gathering training data, aiming at solving problems unique to multilayer perceptrons. One of the problems is that optimum input locations, which are calculated deterministically, sometimes distribute densely around the same point and cause local minima in backpropagation training. Two probabilistic active learning methods, which utilize the statistical variance of locations, are proposed to solve this problem. One is parametric active learning and the other is multipoint-search active learning. Another serious problem in applying active learning to multilayer perceptrons is that a Fisher information matrix can be singular, while many methods, including the proposed ones, assume its regularity. A technique of pruning redundant hidden units is proposed to keep the Fisher information matrix regular. Combined with this technique, active learning can be applied stably to multilayer perceptrons. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through computer simulations on simple artificial problems and a real-world problem of color conversion.},

abstract = {Human development takes place in a social context. Two pervasive sources of social information are faces and hands. Here, we provide the first report of the visual frequency of faces and hands in the everyday scenes available to infants. These scenes were collected by having infants wear head cameras during unconstrained everyday activities. Our corpus of 143hours of infant-perspective scenes, collected from 34 infants aged 1month to 2years, was sampled for analysis at 1/5Hz. The major finding from this corpus is that the faces and hands of social partners are not equally available throughout the first two years of life. Instead, there is an earlier period of dense face input and a later period of dense hand input. At all ages, hands in these scenes were primarily in contact with objects and the spatio-temporal co-occurrence of hands and faces was greater than expected by chance. The orderliness of the shift from faces to hands suggests a principled transition in the contents of visual experiences and is discussed in terms of the role of developmental gates on the timing and statistics of visual experiences.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a perspective on the role of the hippocampal system in generalization, instantiated in a computational model called REMERGE (recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, {\&} O'Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen {\&} Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization-as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.},

By reconsidering cognition with regard to interactions with the world, rather than in terms of the sequestered computa- tional nature of the mind, embodied cognition recasts many of the central issues of the study of thought and behaviour. One of the ways that cognition is seen as embodied is through the close relation of hand gestures with thinking and communication.

abstract = {Generalizations about neural function are often drawn from non-human animal models to human cognition, however, the assumption of cross-species conservation may sometimes be invalid. Humans may use different strategies mediated by alternative structures, or similar structures may operate differently within the context of the human brain. The transitive inference problem, considered a hallmark of logical reasoning, can be solved by non-human species via associative learning rather than logic. We tested whether humans use similar strategies to other species for transitive inference. Results are crucial for evaluating the validity of widely accepted assumptions of similar neural substrates underlying performance in humans and other animals. Here we show that successful transitive inference in humans is unrelated to use of associative learning strategies and is associated with ability to report the hierarchical relationship among stimuli. Our work stipulates that cross-species generalizations must be interpreted cautiously, since performance on the same task may be mediated by different strategies and/or neural systems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Novices tend to use means-ends analysis, which involves working backward from the goal, whereas experts prefer to work forward from the givens of a problem. Experiment 1 was designed to study the course of development of expertise using a subset of kinematics problems. After solving many problems, subjects demonstrated the switch from a means-ends to a forward-chaining strategy. This was associated with the conventional concomitants of expertise such as a decrease in the number of moves required for solution. In addition, the speed at which expertise developed varied for different categories of problems. Subjects appeared to categorize problems according to the order in which equations would be required, with these categories being discovered at nonuniform rates. This was assumed to be due to the differential rate of acquisition of schemas associated with different categories of problems. Experiments 2 and 3, again using kinematics problems, tested the hypothesis that the means-ends strategies used by novices retarded the acquisition of appropriate'schemas. It was suggested that under a means-ends strategy, moves are controlled by the problem goal, which reduces the information obtained by problem solvers concerning problem structure. The use of nonspecific rather than specific goals was found to enhance the acquisition of expertise as measured by the use of a forward-oriented strategy, the number of moves required for solution, and the number of equations written without substitutions. Experiments 4 and 5, using geometry problems, duplicated the enhanced rate of strategy alteration found with reduced goal specificity. The results of Experiments 6 and 7, again using geometry problems, indicated that reduced goal specificity also enhanced the rate at which problem solvers induced appropriate problem categories. It was concluded that in circumstances in which the primary reason for presenting problems is to assist problem solvers in acquiring knowledge concerning problem structure, the use of conventional problems solved by means-ends analysis may not be maximally efficient.},

abstract = {People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms—for action, imagination, and explanation.We present a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world's alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches.We also present several “visual Turing tests” probing the model's creative generalization abilities, which in many cases are indistinguishable from human behavior.},

abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving perfor- mance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recog- nition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

We used fMRI to test the hypotheses that there are specific neural networks dedicated to performing an arithmetic operation (e.g. + or -) and to performing processes that support more complex calculations. We found that the right inferior parietal lobule, left precuneus and left superior parietal gyrus are relatively specific for performing subtraction; and bilateral medial frontal/cingulate cortex are relatively specific for supporting arithmetic procedure complexity. We also found that greater difficulty level was associated with activation in a brain network including left inferior intraparietal sulcus, left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral cingulate. Our results suggest that the network activated by the simplest calculation serves as a common basis, to which more regions are recruited for more difficult problems or different arithmetic operations. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Curriculum learning (CL) or self-paced learning (SPL) represents a recently proposed learning regime inspired by the learning process of humans and animals that gradually proceeds from easy to more complex samples in training. The two methods share a similar concep-tual learning paradigm, but differ in specific learning schemes. In CL, the curriculum is predetermined by pri-or knowledge, and remain fixed thereafter. Therefore, this type of method heavily relies on the quality of pri-or knowledge while ignoring feedback about the learn-er. In SPL, the curriculum is dynamically determined to adjust to the learning pace of the leaner. However, SPL is unable to deal with prior knowledge, rendering it prone to overfitting. In this paper, we discover the missing link between CL and SPL, and propose a u-nified framework named self-paced curriculum leaning (SPCL). SPCL is formulated as a concise optimization problem that takes into account both prior knowledge known before training and the learning progress dur-ing training. In comparison to human education, SPCL is analogous to " instructor-student-collaborative " learn-ing mode, as opposed to " instructor-driven " in CL or " student-driven " in SPL. Empirically, we show that the advantage of SPCL on two tasks. Curriculum learning (Bengio et al. 2009) and self-paced learning (Kumar, Packer, and Koller 2010) have been at-tracting increasing attention in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Both the learning paradigms are inspired by the learning principle underlying the cognitive process of humans and animals, which generally start with learning easier aspects of a task, and then gradually take more complex examples into consideration. The intuition can be explained in analogous to human education in which a pupil is supposed to understand elementary algebra be-fore he or she can learn more advanced algebra topics. This learning paradigm has been empirically demonstrated to be instrumental in avoiding bad local minima and in achieving a better generalization result (Khan, Zhu, and Mutlu 2011; Basu and Christensen 2013; Tang et al. 2012). A curriculum determines a sequence of training samples which essentially corresponds to a list of samples ranked in ascending order of learning difficulty. A major disparity Copyright c 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. between curriculum learning (CL) and self-paced learning (SPL) lies in the derivation of the curriculum. In CL, the cur-riculum is assumed to be given by an oracle beforehand, and remains fixed thereafter. In SPL, the curriculum is dynami-cally generated by the learner itself, according to what the learner has already learned. The advantage of CL includes the flexibility to incorpo-rate prior knowledge from various sources. Its drawback stems from the fact that the curriculum design is determined independently of the subsequent learning, which may result in inconsistency between the fixed curriculum and the dy-namically learned models. From the optimization perspec-tive, since the learning proceeds iteratively, there is no guar-antee that the predetermined curriculum can even lead to a converged solution. SPL, on the other hand, formulates the learning problem as a concise biconvex problem, where the curriculum design is embedded and jointly learned with model parameters. Therefore, the learned model is consis-tent. However, SPL is limited in incorporating prior knowl-edge into learning, rendering it prone to overfitting. Ignoring prior knowledge is less reasonable when reliable prior infor-mation is available. Since both methods have their advan-tages, it is difficult to judge which one is better in practice. In this paper, we discover the missing link between CL and SPL. We formally propose a unified framework called Self-paced Curriculum Leaning (SPCL). SPCL represents a general learning paradigm that combines the merits from both the CL and SPL. On one hand, it inherits and further generalizes the theory of SPL. On the other hand, SPCL ad-dresses the drawback of SPL by introducing a flexible way to incorporate prior knowledge. This paper also discusses concrete implementations within the proposed framework, which can be useful for solving various problems. This paper offers a compelling insight on the relation-ship between the existing CL and SPL methods. Their re-lation can be intuitively explained in the context of human education, in which SPCL represents an " instructor-student collaborative " learning paradigm, as opposed to " instructor-driven " in CL or " student-driven " in SPL. In SPCL, instruc-tors provide prior knowledge on a weak learning sequence of samples, while leaving students the freedom to decide the actual curriculum according to their learning pace. Since an optimal curriculum for the instructor may not necessarily be optimal for all students, we hypothesize that given reason-able prior knowledge, the curriculum devised by instructors and students together can be expected to be better than the curriculum designed by either part alone. Empirically, we substantiate this hypothesis by demonstrating that the pro-posed method outperforms both CL and SPL on two tasks. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first briefly introduce the background knowledge on CL and SPL. Then we propose the model and the algorithm of SPCL. After that, we discuss concrete implementations of SPCL. The experimental results and conclusions are presented in the last two sections.},

abstract = {Skill theory provides tools for predicting developmental sequences and synchronies in any domain at any point in development by integrating behavioral and cognitive-developmental concepts. Cognitive development is explained by skill structures called "levels," together with transformation rules relating these levels to each other. The transformation rules specify the developmental steps by which a skill moves gradually from one level of complexity to the next. At every step in these developmental sequences, the individual controls a particular skill. Skills are gradually transformed from sensory-motor actions to representations and then to abstractions. The transformations produce continuous behavioral changes; but across the entire profile of a person's skills and within highly practiced task domains, a stagelike shift in skills occurs as the person develops to an optimal level. The theory suggests a common framework for integrating developmental analyses of cognitive, social, language, and perceptual-motor skills and certain behavioral changes in learning and problem solving.

In particular, individual prefrontal neurons often generate remarkably complex responses that defy deep understanding of their contribution to behaviour. Here we study prefrontal cortex activity in macaque monkeys trained to flexibly select and integrate noisy sensory inputs towards a choice. We find that the observed complexity and functional roles of single neurons are readily understood in the framework of a dynamical process unfolding at the level of the population. The population dynamics can be reproduced by a trained recurrent neural network, which suggests a previously unknown mechanism for selection and integration of task-relevant inputs. This mechanism indicates that selection and integration are two aspects of a single dynamical process unfolding within the same prefrontal circuits, and potentially provides a novel, general framework for understanding context-dependent computations.},

We develop machine learning systems with this important capacity by developing new deep generative models, models that combine the representational power of deep learning with the inferential power of Bayesian reasoning. We develop a class of sequential generative models that are built on the principles of feedback and attention. These two characteristics lead to generative models that are among the state-of-the art in density estimation and image generation. We demonstrate the one-shot generalization ability of our models using three tasks: unconditional sampling, generating new exemplars of a given concept, and generating new exemplars of a family of concepts. In all cases our models are able to generate compelling and diverse samples---having seen new examples just once---providing an important class of general-purpose models for one-shot machine learning.},

The spread factor is independent of the dimensionality of the data and as such can be used as a controlling measure for generating maps with different dimensionality, which can then be compared and analyzed with better accuracy. The spread factor is also presented as a method of achieving hierarchical clustering of a data set with the GSOM. Such hierarchical clustering allows the data analyst to identify significant and interesting clusters at a higher level of the hierarchy, and as such continue with finer clustering of only the interesting clusters. Therefore, only a small map is created in the beginning with a low spread factor, which can be generated for even a very large data set. Further analysis is conducted on selected sections of the data and as such of smaller volume. Therefore, this method facilitates the analysis of even very large data sets.},

abstract = {Learning of continuous valued functions using neural network ensembles (committees) can give improved accuracy, reliable estimation of the generalization error, and active learning. The ambiguity is defined as the variation of the output of ensemble members averaged over unlabeled data, so it quantifies the disagreement among the networks. It is discussed how to use the ambiguity in combination with cross-validation to give a reliable estimate of the ensemble generalization error, and how this type of ensemble cross-validation can sometimes improve performance. It is shown how to estimate the optimal weights of the ensemble members using unlabeled data. By a generalization of query by committee, it is finally shown how the ambiguity can be used to select new training data to be labeled in an active learning scheme. 1 INTRODUCTION It is well known that a combination of many different predictors can improve predictions.

abstract = {Modern computers separate computation and memory. Computation is performed by a processor, which can use an addressable memory to bring operands in and out of play. This confers two important benefits: the use of extensible storage to write new information and the ability to treat the contents of memory as variables. Variables are critical to algorithm generality: to perform the same procedure on one datum or another, an algorithm merely has to change the address it reads from. In contrast to computers, the computational and memory resources of artificial neural networks are mixed together in the network weights and neuron activity. This is a major liability: as the memory demands of a task increase, these networks cannot allocate new storage dynam-ically, nor easily learn algorithms that act independently of the values realized by the task variables. Although recent breakthroughs demonstrate that neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing 1 , sequence learning 2,3 and reinforcement learning 4 , cognitive scientists and neuroscientists have argued that neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures 5–9 , and to store data over long timescales without interference 10,11 . We aim to combine the advantages of neu-ral and computational processing by providing a neural network with read–write access to external memory. The access is narrowly focused, minimizing interference among memoranda and enabling long-term storage 12,13 . The whole system is differentiable, and can therefore be trained end-to-end with gradient descent, allowing the network to learn how to operate and organize the memory in a goal-directed manner.},

The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of numeracy and the influence of age on these correlates with a group of adults and a group of third graders who had average to above average mathematical ability. Participants performed simple and complex versions of exact and approximate calculation tasks while in the magnet. Like adults, children activated a network of brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes during the calculation tasks, and they recruited additional brain regions for the more complex versions of the tasks. However, direct comparisons between adults and children revealed significant differences in level of activation across all tasks. In particular, patterns of activation in the parietal lobe were significantly different as a function of age. Findings support previous claims that the parietal lobe becomes more specialized for arithmetic tasks with age.},

We studied empirically the reproducibility of this dialogue in educated adults and adolescents of the 21st century. Our results show a remarkable agreement between Socratic and empiric dialogues. Even in questions in which Meno's slave made a mistake, within an unbounded number of possible erred responses, the vast majority of participants produced the same error as Meno's slave. Our results show that the Socratic dialogue is built on a strong intuition of human knowledge and reasoning which persists more than 24 centuries after its conception, providing one of the most striking demonstrations of universality across time and cultures. At the same time, they also emphasize its educational failure. After following every single question including Socrates' "diagonal argument," almost 50{\%} of the participants failed to learn the simplest generalization when asked to double the area of a square of different size. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Here, we formal- ize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them “curricu- lum learning”. In the context of recent re- search studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neu- ral networks), we explore curriculum learn- ing in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generaliza- tion can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).},

In addition, we cannot compare log-odds ratios or odds ratios for similar models across groups, samples, or time points, or across models with different independent variables in a sample.

Although decades of research have focused on the advantages and disadvantages of concrete and abstract materials considered independently, we argue for an approach that moves beyond this dichotomy and combines their advantages. Specifically, we recommend beginning with concretematerials and then explicitly and gradually fading to the more abstract. Theoretical benefits of this “con- creteness fading” technique for mathematics and science instruction include (1) helping learners interpret ambiguous or opaque abstract symbols in terms of well-understood concrete objects, (2) providing embodied perceptual and physical experiences that can ground abstract thinking, (3) enabling learners to build up a store of memorable images that can be used when abstract symbols lose meaning, and (4) guiding learners to strip away extraneous concrete properties and distill the generic, generalizable properties. In these ways, concreteness fading provides advantages that go beyond the sum of the benefits of concrete and abstract materials},

Given enough time for recovery, can a person gain visual skills after several years of congenital blindness? In India, we recently had an unusual opportunity to work with an individual whose case history sheds light on this question. S.R.D. was born blind, and remained so until age 12. She then underwent surgery for the removal of dense congenital cataracts. We evaluated her performance on an extensive battery of visual tasks 20 years after surgery. We found that although S.R.D.'s acuity is compromised, she is proficient on mid- and high-level visual tasks. These results suggest that the human brain retains an impressive capacity for visual learning well into late childhood. They have implications for current conceptions of cortical plasticity and provide an argument for treating congenital blindness even in older children.},

Exposure to orthodontic appliances was verified in dental records.Results. Questionnaire data demonstrated a reduced risk of nickel sensitization whenorthodontic treatment preceded piercing (OR 0.46; CI 0.27–0.78). Data from dentalrecords demonstrated similar results (OR 0.61, CI 0.36–1.02), but statistical significancewas lost when adjusting for background factors. Exposure to full, fixed applianceswith NiTi-containing alloys (OR 0.31, CI 0.10–0.98) as well as a pooled ‘high nickel-releasing' appliance group (OR 0.56, CI 0.32–0.97) prior to piercing was associated witha significantly reduced risk of nickel sensitization.Conclusion. High nickel-containing orthodontic appliances preceding piercingreduces the risk of nickel sensitization by a factor 1.5–2. The risk reduction is associatedwith estimated nickel release of the appliance and length of treatment. Sex, age at piercingand number of piercings are also important risk indicators.

We consider a simple class of programs that can be evaluated with a single left-to-right pass using constant memory. Our main result is that LSTMs can learn to map the character-level representations of such programs to their correct outputs. Notably, it was necessary to use curriculum learning, and while conventional curriculum learning proved ineffective, we developed a new variant of curriculum learning that improved our networks' performance in all experimental conditions. The improved curriculum had a dramatic impact on an addition problem, making it possible to train an LSTM to add two 9-digit numbers with 99{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {How the visual system comes to bind diverse image regions into whole objects is not well understood. We recently had a unique opportunity to investigate this issue when we met three congenitally blind individuals in India. After providing them treatment, we studied the early stages of their visual skills. We found that prominent figural cues of grouping, such as good continuation and junction structure, were largely ineffective for image parsing. By contrast, motion cues were of profound significance in that they enabled intraobject integration and facilitated the development of object representations that permitted recognition in static images. Following 10 to 18 months of visual experience, the individuals' performance improved, and they were able to use the previously ineffective static figural cues to correctly parse many static scenes.

abstract = {Sequence to sequence learning has recently emerged as a new paradigm in supervised learning. To date, most of its applications focused on only one task and not much work explored this framework for multiple tasks. This paper examines three settings to multi-task sequence to sequence learning: (a) the one-to-many setting - where the encoder is shared between several tasks such as machine translation and syntactic parsing, (b) the many-to-one setting - useful when only the decoder can be shared, as in the case of translation and image caption generation, and (c) the many-to-many setting - where multiple encoders and decoders are shared, which is the case with unsupervised objectives and translation. Our results show that training on parsing and image caption generation improves translation accuracy and vice versa. We also present novel findings on the benefit of the different unsupervised learning objectives: we found that the skip-thought objective is beneficial to translation while the sequence autoencoder objective is not.},

Their socio-economic status was significantly lower than that of the rest of the cohort, and 42 per cent had first-degree relatives with learning disabilities. The prevalence of dyscalculia in the original cohort was 6.5 per cent, similar to that of dyslexia and ADHD. However, unlike these other learning disabilities, dyscalculia affected the two sexes in about the same proportions.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

How can we have the idea of a general triangle even though every experience with triangles is with specific ones? Classical cognitive science seemed to provide an answer in symbolic representation. With its easily enumerated necessary and sufficient conditions, the triangle would appear to be a ideal candidate for being represented in a symbolic form. I show that it is not. Across a variety of tasks—drawing, speeded recognition, unspeeded visual judgments, and inference—representations of triangles appear to be graded and contextdependent. I show that using the category name “triangle” activates a more prototypical representation than using an arguably coextensive cue, “three-sided polygon.” For example, when asked to draw “triangles” people draw more typical triangles than when asked to draw “three-sided polygons.” Altogether, the results support the view that (even formal) concepts have a graded and flexible structure which takes on a more prototypical and stable form when activated by category labels.},

Purpose: This application requires a proper conceptualisation of the relation between cognition and brain function. This paper considers two such conceptualisations. The area focus understands each cognitive competency as the product of one (and only one) brain area. The network focus explains each cognitive competency as the product of collaborative processing among multiple brain areas. Sources of evidence: We first review neuroscience studies of mathematical reasoning–specifically arithmetic problem-solving and magnitude comparison–that exemplify the area focus and network focus. We then review neuroscience findings that illustrate the potential of the network focus for informing three topics in mathematics education: the development of mathematical reasoning, the effects of practice and instruction, and the derailment of mathematical reasoning in dyscalculia. Main argument: Although the area focus has historically dominated discussions in educational neuroscience, we argue that the network focus offers a complementary perspective on brain function that should not be ignored. Conclusions: We conclude by describing the current limitations of network-focus theorising and emerging neuroscience methods that promise to make such theorising more tractable in the future.},

We train a recurrent neural network in item-relation-item triples and use this network to test performance on analogy questions. Without training on analogy problems per se, the model explains the developmental shift from associative to relational responding as an emergent consequence of learning upon the environment's statistics. Such learning allows gradual, item-specific acquisition of relational knowledge to overcome the influence of unbalanced association frequency, accounting for association effects of analogical reasoning seen in cognitive development. The network also captures the overall degradation in performance after anterior temporal damage by deleting a fraction of learned connections, while capturing the return of associative dominance after frontal damage by treating frontal structures as necessary for maintaining activation of A and B while seeking a relation between C and D. While our theory is still far from being complete it provides a unified explanation of findings that need to be considered together in any integrated account of analogical reasoning.},

For symbolic numbers (digits), data are consistent and robust across studies and populations: weak performance correlates with low math achievement and dyscalculia. For non-symbolic formats (dots), many conflicting findings have been reported. These inconsistencies might be explained by methodological issues. Alternatively, it might be that the processes measured by non-symbolic tasks are not critical for school-relevant mathematics. A few neuroimaging studies revealed that brain activation during number comparison correlates with the children's mathematics achievement level, but the consistency of such relationships for symbolic and non-symbolic processing is unclear.

In handwritten arithmetic expressions containing both multiplications and additions, terms that are multiplied are often placed physically closer together than terms that are added. Three experiments evaluate the role such physical factors play in how reasoners construct solutions to simple compound arithmetic expressions (such as "2 + 3 × 4"). Two kinds of influence are found: First, reasoners incorporate the physical size of the expression into numerical responses, tending to give larger responses to more widely spaced problems. Second, reasoners use spatial information as a cue to hierarchical expression structure: More narrowly spaced subproblems within an expression tend to be solved first and tend to be multiplied. Although spatial relationships besides order are entirely formally irrelevant to expression semantics, reasoners systematically use these relationships to support their success with various formal properties.},

abstract = {Previous studies have identified sensitive periods for the developing barn owl during which visual experience has a powerful influence on the calibration of sound localization behavior. Here we investigated neural correlates of these sensitive periods by assessing developmental changes in the capacity of visual experience to alter the map of auditory space in the optic tectum of the barn owl. We used two manipulations. (1) We equipped owls with prismatic spectacles that optically displaced the visual field by 23 degrees to the left or right, and (2) we restored normal vision to prism-reared owls that had been raised wearing prisms. In agreement with previous behavioral experiments, we found that the capacity of abnormal visual experience to shift the tectal auditory space map was restricted to an early sensitive period. However, this period extended until later in life (approximately 200 d) than described previously in behavioral studies (approximately 70 d). Furthermore, unlike the previous behavioral studies that found that the capacity to recover normal sound localization after restoration of normal vision was lost at approximately 200 d of age, we found that the capacity to recover a normal auditory space map was never lost. Finally, we were able to reconcile the behaviorally and neurophysiologically defined sensitive periods by taking into account differences in the richness of the environment in the two sets of experiments. We repeated the behavioral experiments and found that when owls were housed in a rich environment, the capacity to adjust sound localization away from normal extended to later in life, whereas the capacity to recover to normal was never lost. Conversely, when owls were housed in an impoverished environment, the capacity to recover a normal auditory space map was restricted to a period ending at approximately 200 d of age. The results demonstrate that the timing and even the existence of sensitive periods for plasticity of a neural circuit and associated behavior can depend on multiple factors, including (1) the nature of the adjustment demanded of the system and (2) the richness of the sensory and social environment in which the plasticity is studied.},

Using methods from Markovian diffusion theory, we formalize the activation dynamics of these networks and then show that they can be trained to reproduce entire multivariate probability distributions on their outputs using the contrastive Hebbian learning rule (CHL).  We show that CHL performs gradient descent on an error function that captures differences between desired and obtained continuous multivariate probability distributions.  This allows the learning algorithm to go beyond expected values of output units and to approximate complete probability distributions on continuous multivariate activation spaces.  We argue that learning continuous distributions is an important task underlying a variety of real life situations which were beyond the scope of previous connectionist networks.  Deterministic networks, like back propagation, cannot learn the task because they are limited to learning average values of independent output units.  Previous stochastic connectionist networks could learn probability distribtions but they were limited to discrete variables.  Simulations show that symmetric diffustion networks can be trained with the CHL rule to approximate discrete and continuous probability distributions of various types.},

Exposure to orthodontic appliances was verified in dental records.Results. Questionnaire data demonstrated a reduced risk of nickel sensitization whenorthodontic treatment preceded piercing (OR 0.46; CI 0.27–0.78).

High nickel-containing orthodontic appliances preceding piercingreduces the risk of nickel sensitization by a factor 1.5–2.

NPI has three learnable components: a task-agnostic recurrent core, a persistent key-value program memory, and domain-specific encoders that enable a single NPI to operate in multiple perceptually diverse environments with distinct affordances. By learning to compose lower-level programs to express higher-level programs, NPI reduces sample complexity and increases generalization ability compared to sequence-to-sequence LSTMs. The program memory allows efficient learning of additional tasks by building on existing programs. NPI can also harness the environment (e.g. a scratch pad with read-write pointers) to cache intermediate results of computation, lessening the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example sequences of calls to the immediate subprograms conditioned on the input. Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns from a small number of rich examples. We demonstrate the capability of our model to learn several types of compositional programs: addition, sorting, and canonicalizing 3D models. Furthermore, a single NPI learns to execute these programs and all 21 associated subprograms.},

In a selection task, the learner actively chooses observations to test his or her beliefs, whereas in reception tasks data are passively encountered. People routinely use both forms of testing in everyday life, but the critical psychological differences between selection and reception learning remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that selection learning improves learning performance by enhancing generic cognitive processes related to motivation, attention, and engagement. Alternatively, we suggest that differences between these 2 learning modes derives from a hypothesis-dependent sampling bias that is introduced when a person collects data to test his or her own individual hypothesis. Drawing on influential models of sequential hypothesis-testing behavior, we show that such a bias (a) can lead to the collection of data that facilitates learning compared with reception learning and (b) can be more effective than observing the selections of another person. We then report a novel experiment based on a popular category learning paradigm that compares reception and selection learning. We additionally compare selection learners to a set of "yoked" participants who viewed the exact same sequence of observations under reception conditions. The results revealed systematic differences in performance that depended on the learner's role in collecting information and the abstract structure of the problem.},

The studies in Part I attempted to foster the abstraction of a problem schema from a single story analog by means of summarization instructions, a verbal statement of the underlying principle, or a diagrammatic representation of it. None of these devices achieved a notable degree of sucess. In contrast, the experiments in Part II demonstrated that if two prior analogs were given, subjects often derived a problem schema as an incidental product of describing the similarities of the analogs. The quality of the induced schema was highly predictive of subsequent transfer performance. Furthermore, the verbal statements and diagrams that had failed to facilitate transfer from one analog proved highly beneficial when paired with two. The function of examples in learning was discussed in light of the present study. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {It is shown that educated adults routinely make errors in placing stimuli into familiar, well-defined categories such as triangle and odd number. Scalene triangles are often rejected as instances of triangles and 798 is categorized by some as an odd number. These patterns are observed both in timed and untimed tasks, hold for people who can fully express the necessary and sufficient conditions for category membership, and for individuals with varying levels of education. A sizeable minority of people believe that 400 is more even than 798 and that an equilateral triangle is the most "trianglest" of triangles. Such beliefs predict how people instantiate other categories with necessary and sufficient conditions, e.g., grandmother. I argue that the distributed and graded nature of mental representations means that human algorithms, unlike conventional computer algorithms, only approximate rule-based classification and never fully abstract from the specifics of the input. This input-sensitivity is critical to obtaining the kind of cognitive flexibility at which humans excel, but comes at the cost of generally poor abilities to perform context-free computations. If human algorithms cannot be trusted to produce unfuzzy representations of odd numbers, triangles, and grandmothers, the idea that they can be trusted to do the heavy lifting of moment-to-moment cognition that is inherent in the metaphor of mind as digital computer still common in cognitive science, needs to be seriously reconsidered. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Does the human capacity for mathematical intuition depend on linguistic competence or on visuo-spatial representations? A series of behavioral and brain-imaging experiments provides evidence for both sources. Exact arithmetic is acquired in a language-specific format, transfers poorly to a different language or to novel facts, and recruits networks involved in word-association processes. In contrast, approximate arithmetic shows language independence, relies on a sense of numerical magnitudes, and recruits bilateral areas of the parietal lobes involved in visuo-spatial processing. Mathematical intuition may emerge from the interplay of these brain systems.},

abstract = {Did evolution endow the human brain with a predisposition to represent and acquire knowledge about numbers? Although the parietal lobe has been suggested as a potential substrate for a domain-specific representation of quantities, it is also engaged in verbal, spatial, and attentional functions that may contribute to calculation. To clarify the organisation of number-related processes in the parietal lobe, we examine the three-dimensional intersection of fMRI activations during various numerical tasks, and also review the corresponding neuropsychological evidence. On this basis, we propose a tentative tripartite organisation. The horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS) appears as a plausible candidate for domain specificity: It is systematically activated whenever numbers are manipulated, independently of number notation, and with increasing activation as the task puts greater emphasis on quantity processing. Depending on task demands, we speculate that this core quantity system, analogous to an internal "number line," can be supplemented by two other circuits. A left angular gyrus area, in connection with other left-hemispheric perisylvian areas, supports the manipulation of numbers in verbal form. Finally, a bilateral posterior superior parietal system supports attentional orientation on the mental number line, just like on any other spatial dimension.},

abstract = {Previous studies have found that the strategies used by expert and novice problem solvers differ. Novices tend to use means-ends analysis, which involves working backward from the goal, whereas experts prefer to work forward from the givens of a problem. Experiment 1 was designed to study the course of development of expertise using a subset of kinematics problems. After solving many problems, subjects demonstrated the switch from a means-ends to a forward-chaining strategy. This was associated with the conventional concomitants of expertise such as a decrease in the number of moves required for solution. In addition, the speed at which expertise developed varied for different categories of problems. Subjects appeared to categorize problems according to the order in which equations would be required, with these categories being discovered at nonuniform rates. This was assumed to be due to the differential rate of acquisition of schemas associated with different categories of problems. Experiments 2 and 3, again using kinematics problems, tested the hypothesis that the means-ends strategies used by novices retarded the acquisition of appropriate'schemas. It was suggested that under a means-ends strategy, moves are controlled by the problem goal, which reduces the information obtained by problem solvers concerning problem structure. The use of nonspecific rather than specific goals was found to enhance the acquisition of expertise as measured by the use of a forward-oriented strategy, the number of moves required for solution, and the number of equations written without substitutions. Experiments 4 and 5, using geometry problems, duplicated the enhanced rate of strategy alteration found with reduced goal specificity. The results of Experiments 6 and 7, again using geometry problems, indicated that reduced goal specificity also enhanced the rate at which problem solvers induced appropriate problem categories. It was concluded that in circumstances in which the primary reason for presenting problems is to assist problem solvers in acquiring knowledge concerning problem structure, the use of conventional problems solved by means-ends analysis may not be maximally efficient.},

abstract = {I explore a belief about learning and teaching that is commonly held in education and society at large that nonetheless is deeply flawed. The belief asserts that mastery of formalisms—specialized representations such as symbolic equations and diagrams with no inherent meaning except that which is established by convention—is prerequisite to applied knowledge. A formalisms first (FF) view of learning, rooted in Western dualist philosophy, incorrectly advocates the introduction of formalisms too early in the development of learners' conceptual understanding and can encourage a formalisms-only mind-set toward learning and instruction. I identify the prevalence of FF in curriculum and instruction and outline some of the serious problems engendered by FF approaches. I then turn to promising alternatives that support progressive formalization, problem-based learning, and inquiry learning, which capitalize on the strengths of formalisms but avoid some of the most costly problems found in FF approaches.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging findings in adults suggest exact and approximate number processing relying on distinct neural circuits. In the present study we are investigating whether this cortical specialization is already established in 9- and 12-year-old children. Using fMRI, brain activation was measured in 10 third- and 10 sixth-grade school children and 20 adults during trials of symbolic approximate (AP) and exact (EX) calculation, as well as non-symbolic magnitude comparison (MC) of objects. Children activated similar networks like adults, denoting an availability and a similar spatial extent of specified networks as early as third grade. However, brain areas related to number processing become further specialized with schooling. Children showed weaker activation in the intraparietal sulcus during all three tasks, in the left inferior frontal gyrus during EX and in occipital areas during MC. In contrast, activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus, a region associated with attentional effort and working memory load, was enhanced in children. Moreover, children revealed reduced or absent deactivation of regions involved in the so-called default network during symbolic calculation, suggesting a rather general developmental effect. No difference in brain activation patterns between AP and EX was found. Behavioral results indicated major differences between children and adults in AP and EX, but not in MC. Reaction time and accuracy rate were not correlated to brain activation in regions showing developmental changes suggesting rather effects of development than performance differences between children and adults. In conclusion, increasing expertise with age may lead to more automated processing of mental arithmetic, which is reflected by improved performance and by increased brain activation in regions related to number processing and decreased activation in supporting areas.},
